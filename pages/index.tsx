    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <article>
      <p>Hi, my name is Mauro Colella. I am a senior software developer with twenty years of activity in the IT industry. I develop great websites for great companies that offer great services.</p>
      <p>I specialize in web applications and full-stack development, as well as user experience. From DevOps to responsive interfaces and tailored, well-optimized data visualizations, I am fluent with a broad range of technologies for the Internet.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>I have been successfully freelancing my services for the last ten years, with a strong focus on customer needs in both the business and the market.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>I am European, I trained in Switzerland, and I reside in Asia.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>When I am not in front of the computer, my interests range from being a dad to learning about art, motion graphics, architecture and much more.</p>
      <p>For me, command of information technology is a means to empower people to share and access information. It is first and foremost a means to enable and facilitate intercommunication.</p>
      <br/>
